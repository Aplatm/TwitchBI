--> The purpose of this project is to present in a visual way the results obtained from the project carried out the previous week (ETL).

--> This visualization is focused on an external view, without going into details of categories of classification of time spent.

--> The objective is to be able to observe the 3 key points in classifying the "success" of the top 50 streamers and their evolution in the years 2020 and 2022.

--> The tool used for this visualization is PowerBI.
